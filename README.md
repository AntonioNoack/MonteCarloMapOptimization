# MonteCarloMapOptimization
Just a little experiment inspired by https://youtu.be/Lq-Y7crQo44

## Libraries:
This experiment is using [my video editor Rem's Studio](https://github.com/AntonioNoack/RemsStudio/) as its engine.

## Limitations:
- no voting gerrymandering
- keeping borders clean is tricky, or extremely expensive; it currently is not real-time capable or produces bad results

## Features:
- use your own shape at runtime
- decide the number of districts at runtime
- play with the randomness at runtime
- different distance metrics usable for optimization; can be changed at runtime as well
- a button to restart ðŸ˜„
